# YOS - Year Of Service

An App designed for a University High School service leadership project.

YOS was orginally designed to help students better document their community service hours. They can do so by submitting a simple form in the App immediately before or after a service project to log their community impact as well as submitting supporting evidence such as photos or videos. The data collected was used to recognize the high-achieving community service members in our school community and also helped compiling a annual report for the school. This report served as the basis of our application to the Jefferson Awards Foundation's Students In Action (SIA) program in 2017, in which UHS ultimately won second place.

This iOS App was built with Firebase.
